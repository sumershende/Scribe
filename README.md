#Scribe
####Scribe is an AI driven system which automatically generates output in a user defined format based on raw data that is fed to it. It is a tedious and progressively difficult task for a human to process large volumes of data and deliver meaningful output in a scenario where things are changing by the minute. Thus “SCRIBE” reorganizes raw data into furnished output as required by the user whether it be in the form of an essay, article, post or letter. “SCRIBE” collects raw data and stores it in a file system. It applies adequate business rules for data cleaning, standardization and mining.
The goal of the system is to design and build software that will analyze, understand, and generate languages that humans use naturally. For this we use the concept of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is a field of computer science concerned with interactions between computers and human languages.

#Important stuff Vineet!
```python
I have not included the StanfordNLP jar file for the models i.e. stanford-corenlp-3.6.0-models  
This file is almost 3gigs and could not be uploaded via my github account.  
If and when you want to run this, just make sure you put that file in the lib folder and you should be good to go.
##Delete this after reading!
