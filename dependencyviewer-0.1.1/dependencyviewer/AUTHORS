Awais Athar (see http://chaoticity.com/dependensee-a-dependency-parse-visualisation-tool/) has provided the original tool but has not provided source code and licensing is unclear.

Bernard Bou <bbou@ac-toulouse.fr> has written this software program from scratch -- retaining however Awais Athar's laying-out ideas and values so that the output is near-identical -- and put the software under GPL3.
