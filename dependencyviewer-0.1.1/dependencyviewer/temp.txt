According to the great futurist Ray Kurzweil's "Law of Accelerating Returns" - human advancement moves snappier and speedier as time goes on. Every time I watch "Star Trek", the use of "Bio-scan" always made me wonder if it was really possible to build one. When I started looking for answers online something else arrested my mind. It was the auto-complete feature on Google Search. The kind of query optimization used by Google was something I could not pictures even with my flair for algorithm development and programming. Trying to understand how this modern witchcraft works, I came across the term Artificial Intelligence. The whole concept of machines being able to think like humans bewitched me. Furthermore, the ideas of self-learning algorithms and their execution on huge amounts of data, introduced the concepts of Machine Learning and Data Mining. For the past two years, I have been studying different artificial intelligence expert systems and have tried to create one of my own. It is very clear to me that every field is inter-related and that an intelligent system is a perfect blend of all these domains. This led to my conclusion that no single field in Computer Sciences can satiate my hunger for knowledge. Hence I want to pursue General Computer Sciences. 
My first programming experience was 8thgrade where they taught us how to make simple HTML pages. Writing a few lines of codes and seeing them transform into a webpage was just fascinating.  Curious as to how this all really actually worked, I stopped for a read. Turns out, a few simple <br> tags here and some <img> tags there is all that is needed to yield my very first webpage which I affectionately called "Sumer's site"
This was my inception into the complex world of 1s and 0s. Eventually I started developing small web applications making a small website for my uncle’s furniture manufacturing company at the age of 12. The praises I received from this small endeavour motivated me to learn CSS, Jquery and JavaScript to compliment my web developing skills, after which I made for websites for many local companies charging them a minimum fee, enough to get me going for a week without asking for pocket money.
In my tenth grade we were taught Java as a part of our curriculum, and boy did I enjoy it! I was not satisfied with the limited knowledge of the syllabus so I switched to a new teacher –“The Internet”. Being good at sports and having strong academics and other extracurricular activities, I was chosen as the Head Boy of my school which gave me a huge platform to develop my time management and leadership skills at an early stage.
In my junior college, I got ample amount of time to spare, so I took up many activities spanning from teaching homeless children to learning to play the guitar and also got involved with cultural committees for organizing multiple large scale events in different colleges. The rest of the days were spent browsing the Internet and reading books to self-tutor myself different programming languages like C and Python along with Android Development.
It was very sure that I wanted to become a Computer Engineer. My undergraduate curriculum laid a foundation in the mathematical, scientific and engineering fundamentals. It presented me to various programming languages and platforms. It was during my undergrad when I initially begun utilizing Unix based operating frameworks and became proficient in Linux. Distinctive courses like 'Software Engineering', 'SOOAD' and 'Project Management' taught me how an extensive scale project is actualized in addition to teaching different ethics vital in the corporate world. 'Distributed Database Management' tossed light on complex parts of overseeing large chucks of data in a more effective way. All these courses were accompanied by project work which was the best part of academia for me. Theoretical knowledge is great, but applying new technologies and building stuff is even more amazing. And so I started building something -$$can’t think of anything, take ideas from someone.
In addition to these I worked on a number of projects of my own. I published two Android apps and one iOS app, participated in countless coding competitions winning two and reaching the third round in the TATA Counsultancy Services’s Codevita. Side by side I participated in six different student bodies and got elected as a core member in all of them. As part of these committees, I conducted multiple workshops like Android App development, Ethical Hacking and robotics based on Arduino. In addition to these, I was appointed as the Secretary General of RGIT Model United Nations(MUN) and organised a city wide conference, a first in the history of my college. All this helped me boost confidence, taught me teamwork along with the ability to come up with innovative and creative solutions to problems; and to assist team members to draw out the best in them.
In my second year I took up an MTA course in Microsoft .NET Framework wherein I learnt concepts of .Net Framework we produced a Windows application which is at present being used in the our college for administrating and monitoring the use of computers on campus. But I wasn't satisfied with making a bunch of games and small utility tools. I wanted something more.. something different.. something futuristic.. something that could make a difference, a way of making my contribution to the information explosion. 
It was while going through TedX archieves, I found a lecture on Artificial Intelligence. The idea of computers being able to think like a person just mesmerized me. I wanted to understand this better so I took up a couple of courses on edX. First one being the 'Artificial Intelligence' course by UCBerkeleyX which acquainted me with essential ideas of computerized intelligence and numerous uninformed heuristic algorithms used to make a machine intelligent. We were given assignments on Unix-Python which were reviewed by the automated grader. The course concluded with giving basic knowledge of neural networks, robotics and natural language processing. These concepts are currently a part of my college curriculum and are being studied profoundly.
The second course I took was the 'Scalable Machine Learning' course which centered around the nuts and bolts of the statistical and algorithmic parts involved in the deployment of large-scale machine learning pipelines. Practical implementation was done on Apache Spark in a virtual environment. Albeit I did not complete the course, it laid a foundation for my understanding about this branch of computer science.
During my winter break I got the opportunity of interning in Talec Industries and being a part of their “Manufacturing Automation Project”. This system integrated different section of the production line onto a single control panel allowing processing of data from different sensors in real time by the system and taking the correct action, thereby making the entire production line robust and automated.
In the next couple of months, I spent making a Web portal for UG students in Mumbai, a forum for discussions and sharing notes. It also had a “Chat Bot” which automatically answer questions asked based on keyword architecture and redirect user to relevant pages. This became my very first independent AI driven system. Subsequently I did an internship in Rash Networking Solutions wherein I worked on a project for refining automated network problem detection. It was a tedious task of studying an already implemented technology and to track down the problem with no proper documentation. But in a two months’ time, our team was able to remove major flaws from the software. 
As my understanding about the subject grew further, I realized how large its scope is. I thought of using these concepts to solve a more social issue. Increasing stringent water supply, and aging water supply infrastructure have resulted in concerns over the viability of adequate water for consumption and sanitary purposes. I have published a technical paper proposing the use of digital computers for data acquisition and supervisory control. The proposed system eclectically generates a plan to manage the available water is such a manner so as to fulfil the water needs of people in a systematic manner mitigate the impact of water use on the environment moderate the use of water so as to avoid insufficient water supply over the entire year.
In the wake working on different domains of artificial intelligence, my enthusiasm for these fields have been rising indefinitely. Studying AI alongside soft computing as part of my current curriculum, has given me a better understanding of these fields. Additionally it introduced me to concepts of narrative sciences, neural networks, image processing and fuzzy inference systems. Currently, I am working on a project “Scribe” – a natural language generation system which would aid user in writing English text compositions. By making use of Apache OpenNLP library we designed a module to read multiple documents to learn the syntax and adapt to the writing style and store this information in different lexicons, and then only with a few words input it can produce well written text. This can be used for real time article compositions much like a robot journalist In essence “SCRIBE” approaches the highest epoch of artificial intelligence to automate creative human tasks like writing. 
I plan to acquire the highest quality of training in order to contribute to the technological world. I wish to be employed by one of the most prestigious companies where I can further expand my knowledge and develop new technologies which could make our lives even better. It will be a dream come true to be hired by Google so that I can aid them in their mission of building a smarter world. With the kind of resources one can obtain at such an institution, building a better system would be feasible. But this dream of mine will not be possible without the right quality of education, the one provided at $$XYZ university.
I want to continue my journey of studying Computers Science, and further understand logic and algorithm development to make computer increasingly more intelligent along with the overall development of myself in the society. I plan to achieve this not only through academics but also via numerous project opportunities provided by the university. This will give me the chance to contribute my bit to the fields' comprehension. I likewise plan to tune in diverse student bodies to understand distinctive cultures, actively participating in numerous extracurricular activities and social work. 
I trust that my relationship with the Computer Science department will be a mutually gainful one.

And although all movies based on artificial intelligence seem to lead a "machine taking over the world" revolution, but let's face it, it will be pretty damn cool to have super intelligent humanoids as pets.
